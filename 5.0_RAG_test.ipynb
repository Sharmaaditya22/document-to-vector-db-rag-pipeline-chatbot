Note this is a simple forecast using observed revenue behavior and margin patterns; actual results can vary with seasonality, costs, and market factors. Also, Q4 2025 profit figure isn’t given, so margins are derived from Q1–Q3.\n",

      "- Total 2025 revenue (Q1–Q4): ₹19.65 lakh? Wait — in crores: ₹1.965 crore (₹19.65 million).\n",
      "- Quarterly revenues: Q1 ₹4.50 million, Q2 ₹3.85 million, Q3 ₹5.20 million, Q4 ₹6.10 million.\n",
      "- Quarterly margins (profit/revenue): Q1 ~11.6%, Q2 ~-3.9%, Q3 ~15.6%. Average of Q1–Q3 margin ≈ 7.75%.\n",

      "- Summary: Revenue ≈ ₹2.21 crore; Profit ≈ ₹17–18 lakh.\n",

      "2) Conservative\n",

      "- 2026 profit: 7.0% of revenue ≈ ₹14–15 lakh.\n",

      "- 2026 profit: 9% of revenue ≈ ₹21–22 lakh.\n",
